Hey my names Jak! I am currently a 1st Year student at Staffordshire University. I am currently studying Game Design and devlopment and I am an absolute computer wiz, or as other would say a bit of a nerd. I would say i'm only still at a intermediate level of programming, with much more to learn but I can still put my skills to use that I've learnt so far and I can't wait to see what you think!

- Studied Games Development in college
Grade Achieved: D,D,D / Distinction, Distinction, Distinction

- Previous Work Expiernce with YellowPhin Media web design
Created interactive mobile advertisement while taken on as an intern

### My inspiration!

Even though now i'm still at a very basic level of programming, I have a few ideas cooking up and of course all of these ideas didn't come without inspiration. One of my faviourte Game titles would be the fallout franchise. I owe alot to this title. As one of the first ever games played, it showed me how much happniess and intrest video games can bring not only to my own life but others and without it I don't think I would have chose the path today.

## Enough about me! Now to my creations!

# Pacman Project

## About the Project 

### How difficult did you find this project?

I'm going to be honest. At first I did find the project quite difficult to wrap my head around but seeing as I was just starting out at the time and in all honestly completley new to programming but I did not let that stop me. There are a few features I wish I implemented to this game while I had a chance but all in all, for a first time programming assignment I believe it actullay turned out quite well and I also really enjoyed doing it

### How did you create this project?

This program was written in C++ a language that I did find difficult at the beginning but I am wrapping my head around it, with each project I complete. As it was only a starter project for my first semester Assignment, we were simply given the skeleton code with a built in application window and a static Pacman sprite. From this and much hard work you can see how much improvement was made to the code with Ai being implemented, collision and random munchie generator. A lot of work went into the project and i'm very happy to say the least with what was produced.

### Open GL 3D cube application

### How difficult did you find this project?

With the 3d Cubes it was a new area to me. The first time being introduced the Open GL. But really this project gave me a much deeper insight into more complex levels of Programming. We had much harder obstacles in our way when completing this program. I had to learn Arrays and how Arrays are structured and used by developers to store positions of objects or for my instance to store each point of the cube. We also had to learn about File IO and how to read and write data from external files and actually implement these Files to store data and allow the system to actually access and read that data. Most of the data for my cube is actually read from an external .txt file and with the help of inheritance allowing more cleaner code with allowing classes to inherit attributes from similar classes without the unnecessary need for large amounts of code.

### How did you create this project?

Using the Open Gl graphics Library, it provided us with features, that made it much easier to actually render and develop a cube without it. The cube was created by various amount of statements that basically is telling the computer to iterate a certain amount of cubes and then stop when it reaches a pre defined amount. That's all very over simplified but would take much longer to break down on one page!

## Thanks for Reading 

That's all I have for now! If you'd like to check out my social media the links wile be down in the description including repositories for both of my Games if you'd like to have a look at the code yourself!
